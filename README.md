# FISHY

This is a proof-of-concept of an advanced phishing attack.

###### Demo site - https://openworldoperations.github.io/FISHY/

#### It works by creating a fake browser window and inserting a phishing page into the fake window. In order for the attacker to set valid SSL certificates and domain.

The only way the victim could notice the attack, is if the victim tried to drag the phishing site window outside of their current browser.

You could further improve on this implementation and allow them to inspect the SSL certificate and input a valid certificate.

This code was created in a couple of hours and is really unstable. However, the concept is simple. Yet intricate.

Be careful of what you think is a legitimate site!
