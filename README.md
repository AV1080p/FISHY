# FISHY
This is a proof-of-concept of an advanced phishing attack.

The only way you could notice the attack, is if you tried to drag the phishing window (What you think is a Chromium browser window.) outside of the current browser.

This code was created in a couple of hours and is really unstable. However, the concept is simple. Yet intricate.

Be careful of what you think is a legitimate site!
